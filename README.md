# Neural Style Transfer: Neural Networks in Action

![Stylized Image Example](result.jpg)

## [Try it on Kaggle](your-kaggle-notebook-link-here)

This project demonstrates the key concepts from neural networks:
- Feature extraction (forward pass)
- Backpropagation
- Gradient descent optimization

## What is Style Transfer?

Neural style transfer takes two images - a content image and a style image - and blends them together so the output looks like the content but painted in the style of the style image.

## How It Works

1. **Feature Extraction**: The neural network identifies content features and style patterns
2. **Optimization Process**: Using backpropagation and gradient descent, the image is gradually updated
3. **Output Generation**: The final image preserves the content while adopting the artistic style

## Neural Network Visualization

This project visualizes how different layers of the neural network "see" the image:

Layer 1 | Layer 2 | Layer 3 | Layer 4
:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:
Edges   | Textures | Patterns | Parts

## Behind the Scenes

The same principles explained in the [micrograd implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch/VMj-3S1tku0) are at work here:
- Networks of computational nodes
- Forward pass to compute values
- Backward pass to compute gradients
- Gradient-based optimization
